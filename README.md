# C++ Learning Projects Repository

## Repository Description

This repository is a collection of C++ projects designed to help understand and implement core programming concepts, memory management strategies, and system-level designs from scratch. Each project focuses on a specific topic or technique, allowing for hands-on experimentation and building expertise in C++ development.

---

## Purpose

* To explore C++ features and best practices through small, self-contained projects.
* To implement fundamental data structures, memory management systems, and algorithms from scratch.
* To provide a reference for learning and demonstrating C++ skills.

---

## Structure

Each folder/project in this repository typically contains:

* **Source code** (`.cpp`/`.h`) demonstrating the implementation.
* **CMakeLists.txt** for easy building.
* **README.md** explaining the project, usage, and key concepts.
* **Examples** or test cases showcasing functionality.

---

## Example Topics Covered

* Reference-counted Garbage Collection (single and multi-object)
* Thread-safe memory management
* Smart pointer implementations
* Low-level system designs and optimizations

---

## Usage

* Clone the repository.
* Navigate to the project folder.
* Build using CMake.
* Run the examples to see implementations in action.

---

This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting, learning, and demonstrating professional-grade C++ implementations from scratch.
